    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 text-center">
      A "stain" is a binary spot in an image, where white pixels represent the
      spot and black pixels the background. It is used in image analysis to
      estimate areas of interest.

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 text-center">
      <b>n</b> random points are generated within the image. The number of
      points that fall inside the white spot is counted.

    <span class="font-bold mb-2 text-blue-700">How is the area estimated?</span>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 text-center">
      The estimated area is:<br /><b
        >Area = (Total area) × (points inside / n)</b
      ><br />
      Where "Total area" is the width × height of the image, "points inside" is
      the number of points that fall inside the spot, and "n" is the total
      number of generated points.

    <span class="font-bold mb-2 text-blue-700">What does the result mean?</span>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 text-center">
      The result is an estimate of the spot area in square pixels. You can
      compare different images or point configurations. If you repeat the
      process, you will see that the result varies slightly due to randomness,
      but stabilizes with more points.
